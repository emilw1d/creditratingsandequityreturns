# Credit Ratings and Equity Returns

This was a project I did at the University of Michigan in the course of Prof. Jason Hall.

In this project I analysed the relationship between credit ratings and subsequent equity returns. Along the way, I also investigated the implied default probability of the market and could compare it with the default probability as assessed by credit agencies.

For the analysis, I used R and datasets from various financial data providers.
